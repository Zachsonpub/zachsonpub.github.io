  <h1 class="project-title">Alcatel</h1>
  <p class="project-body">Alcatel, a mobile device manufacturer, created a smartwatch with a custom OS. In order to educate their customers
  on the system, an intereactive walkthrough was created to demonstrate basic functions. For some reason, the client could not
  provide their library of visual assets, so I was tasked to recreate the entire OS by eye. All assets were vector based for scaling
  and animation. It was a nice change of scenery getting out of photoshop for a few&nbsp;days.</p>
